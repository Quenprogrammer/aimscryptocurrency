        Before diving into token creation, it's essential to understand the core concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrencies:

        After writing the smart contract, you can compile and deploy it using Truffle. Here's how you can do that:

        1. **Initialize a Truffle Project**:
            - Create a new directory for your project and run:
            \`\`\`
            truffle init
            \`\`\`

        2. **Add Your Solidity Contract**:
            - Place the \`MyToken.sol\` file in the \`contracts\` directory of your Truffle project.

        3. **Create a Migration Script**:
            - Create a migration script in the \`migrations\` directory. Name the script \`2_deploy_contracts.js\` and add the following code:
            \`\`\`
            const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

            - You can check the total supply of tokens by calling the \`totalSupply\` function:
            \`\`\`
            const totalSupply = await myToken.totalSupply();
            console.log(totalSupply.toString());
