            \`\`\`
            truffle init
            \`\`\`

        2. **Add Your Solidity Contract**:
            - Place the \`MyToken.sol\` file in the \`contracts\` directory of your Truffle project.

        3. **Create a Migration Script**:
            - Create a migration script in the \`migrations\` directory. Name the script \`2_deploy_contracts.js\` and add the following code:
            \`\`\`
            const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

Since C doesn't have native libraries for Ethereum like other languages (e.g., JavaScript’s Web3.js), we will rely on HTTP requests via libcurl to communicate with Ethereum nodes.\n\n**libcurl** is a powerful C library used for making HTTP requests, which is essential for sending JSON-RPC requests to Ethereum nodes (e.g., Infura). Here's how to install it:\n\n##### For Linux (e.g., Ubuntu):\n\`\`\`bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev\n\`\`\`\n##### For macOS (using Homebrew):\n\`\`\`bash\nbrew install curl\n\`\`\`\n\nOnce libcurl is installed, you can use it to send HTTP requests to the Ethereum network.\n\n#### 1.2: Set Up an Ethereum Node\nTo interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you’ll need access to an Ethereum node.
